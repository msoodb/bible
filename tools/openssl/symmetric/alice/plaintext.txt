FROM: Maj. Francis Hart, 19th Infantry Division
SUBJECT: Letter of recommendation for Capt Kapaun, 19th Infantry Division

1. This letter is to support the consideration upgrade of the Distinguished Service Cross
awarded to Captain Jigar Kapaun to a posthumous award of the Medal of Honor.

2. I had the honor of serving alongside Captain Kapaun  for 5 years. Our  last deployment 
was in Afghanistan where we set up a Security Partnering Team. During one of the scouting 
missions, Captain Kapaun and his tactical teamwere suppressed by heavyfire. A grenade was
thrown into the building where the team had taken cover. Capin Kapaun, in act of fearless
heroism, dove  on the grenade before detonation. This action saved the lives of 4 men and
protected multiple others from severe injuries.

3. Captain Kapaun was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross but believe is act of valor 
should be recognized with the highest decoration; the Medal of Honor. I amm sure you, too
will appreciate his act of courage and bravery and take this request into consideration.

Sincerely,
Maj. Francis Hart
