MEMORANDUM FOR: Maj. G. Scott Vander Hamm, Air Force
FROM: Capt. Guion Preston, Airfield Operations
SUBJECT: Letter of recommendation for 2d Lt Kyle Suthers

Second Lieutenant Kyle Suthers has played an integral role at Keesler AFB. He has helped keep this base organized for the better part of 3 years and now aspires to become a pilot. 2d. Lt. Suthers has my full support in this endeavor.

2d. Lt. Suthers is a very capable, intelligent, and driven individual. Standing a cut above his peers, he exhibits unlimited potential. He is dedicated, focused, self-disciplined and shows remarkable leadership.

2d. Lt. Suthers consistently applies good judgement while tending to his responsibilities. Being an officer in charge of air traffic controllers, RAPCON, airfield management, and ATCALS, has provided an excellent starting point for a pilot. Although his current position does not require this, he is proficient in theory of flight, air navigation, and aircraft operating procedures.

As a skilled professional with an outstanding work ethic, 2d. Lt. Suthers will use his expertise and aptitude to become a successful pilot. I strongly suggest you take his application into close consideration. My contact details are below should any further information be required.
