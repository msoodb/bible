Network Security

Base Network Security Control Levels:
- Physical
- Technical
- Administrative

The main approaches:
- Access Control
- Threat Control

The key elements of Access Control:
- Firewall Protection
- Network Access Control (NAC)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Load Balancing
- Network Segmentation
- Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
- Zero Trust Model

The key elements of Threat Control:
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS)
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Endpoint Protection
- Cloud Security
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Network Traffic Analysis & Network Detection and Response

Typical Network Security Management Operation:
- Deployment
- Configuration
- Management
- Monitoring
- Maintenance

Managed Security Services (MSS):
- Network Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Incident Response
- Behavioural Analysis
