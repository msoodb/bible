# Process
- Reconnaissance
- Scanning
- Gaining Access
- Maintaining Access
- Clearing Tracks
- Reporting

## 1- Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the phase where the attacker gathers information about a target using active or passive means. The tools that are widely used in this process are 
- NMAP
- Hping
- Google Dorks

## 2- Scanning
In this process, the attacker begins to actively probe a target machine or network for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. The tools used in this process are 
- Nessus
- Nexpose
- NMAP

## 3- Gaining Access
In this process, the vulnerability is located and you attempt to exploit it in order to enter into the system. The primary tool that is used in this process is 
- Metasploit

## 4- Maintaining Access
It is the process where the hacker has already gained access into a system. After gaining access, the hacker installs some backdoors in order to enter into the system when he needs access in this owned system in future. The preferred tool in this process is
- Metasploit

## 5- Clearing Tracks
This process is actually an unethical activity. It has to do with the deletion of logs of all the activities that take place during the hacking process.

## 6- Reporting
Reporting is the last step of finishing the ethical hacking process. Here the Ethical Hacker compiles a report with his findings and the job that was done such as the tools used, the success rate, vulnerabilities found, and the exploit processes.
