Vulnerability
- A security vulnerability is a weakness an adversary could take advantage of to compromise the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of a resource. Examples of notable vulnerabilities are Buffer overflow, Heartbleed, Shellshock/Bash and POODLE.

Exploits are very specific. They work ONLY under very specific circumstances. There are a few main reasons why something that is theoretically vulnerable is not actually exploitable:
- There may be insufficient public information to enable attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
- Doing so may require prior authentication or local system access that the attacker does not have.
- Existing security controls may make it hard to attack.

Vulnerable vs. Exploitable
- vulnerable means there is theoretically a way to exploit something (i.e., a vulnerability exists).
- exploitable means that there is a definite path to doing so in the wild

Pentesting vs Vulnerability Scanning
- vulnerability Assessment
- penetration Test

Top 4 Penetration Testing Methodologies
- OSSTMM
- OWASP
- NIST
- PTES

Penetration Test Process
1- Reconnaissance
2- Scanning
3- Gaining Access
4- Maintaining Access
5- Clearing Tracks
