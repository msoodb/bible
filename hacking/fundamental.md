# Process

## 1- Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the phase where the attacker gathers information about a target using active or passive means. 

## 2- Scanning
In this process, the attacker begins to actively probe a target machine or network for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. 

## 3- Gaining Access
In this process, the vulnerability is located and you attempt to exploit it in order to enter into the system. 

## 4- Maintaining Access
It is the process where the hacker has already gained access into a system. After gaining access, the hacker installs some backdoors in order to enter into the system when he needs access in this owned system in future. 

## 5- Clearing Tracks
This process is actually an unethical activity. It has to do with the deletion of logs of all the activities that take place during the hacking process.
