# A 301 redirect
means you permanently redirect a URL to another URL. You automatically redirect visitors and search engines 
from web page A to web page B without causing them any inconvenience.


# 301 vs 302 redirect
Besides a 301 redirect, the 302 redirect exists. Whereas 301 is a permanent redirect, 
302 is a temporary redirect. You redirect visitors and search engines for a specific time, 
for example, if a product is temporarily sold out. 
After some time, you remove the redirect to make the page accessible again.
