# Vulnerability
A security vulnerability is a weakness an adversary could take advantage of to compromise the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of a resource. Examples of notable vulnerabilities are Buffer overflow, Heartbleed, Shellshock/Bash and POODLE.

<br/>

## Vulnerable vs. Exploitable
- vulnerable means there is theoretically a way to exploit something (i.e., a vulnerability exists).
- exploitable means that there is a definite path to doing so in the wild

Hackers normally use vulnerability scanners to find these vulnerabilities:
- Nessus
- Nexpose
- OpenVAS

Exploits are very specific. They work ONLY under very specific circumstances. There are a few main reasons why something that is theoretically vulnerable is not actually exploitable:
- There may be insufficient public information to enable attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
- Doing so may require prior authentication or local system access that the attacker does not have.
- Existing security controls may make it hard to attack.

<br/>

## Private Vulnerability
Zero-day vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that have not been publicly disclosed and are kept private. 

<br/>

## Public Vulnerability Repositories
There are several public vulnerability repositories available that allow interested parties to have easy access to information regarding known vulnerabilities.
- ExploitDB [https://www.exploit-db.com/]
- NVD [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search]
- CVE Mitre [https://www.cve.org/]
- OVAL [https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository]

## Exploit-DB in Linux/Fedora
```sh
sudo snap install searchsploit
```
- command
```sh
searchsploit joomla
searchsploit joomla -w
searchsploit joomla --exclude="plugin"
searchsploit joomla | grep facebook
searchsploit metasploit joomla
searchsploit 38797
searchsploit -p 38797
searchsploit 38797 --examine
```

- Examining Nmap result
```sh
nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org -oX nmap.xml
searchsploit --nmap nmap.xml
```

## Vulnerability Management Program
With a platform like Threat Stackâ€™s "Vulnerability Assessment", you can automatically categorize vulnerabilities according to security risk and see which of your servers are affected by which vulnerabilities.
