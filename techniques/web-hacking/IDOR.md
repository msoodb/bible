# IDOR
Insecure direct object references

## How IDOR attacks can occurs:
IDOR attacks occur when an attacker can directly reference a sensitive object without any Authentication/Authorization. 
In ecommerce websites, this can occur when a page or URL includes a reference to private data, 
but does not properly check the userâ€™s Authentication/Authorization to access that data.
